Description:
Predicted mental health treatment outcomes using survey data and a range of machine learning models. Included SHAP for explainability and LLMs to generate natural language insights.

Files Overview:

part1.rmd
Implements Generalized Additive Model (GAM), computes SHAP values, and uses a Language Model to generate human-readable explanations for predictions.

part2.rmd
Contains training and evaluation of Random Forest, MLP, SVM, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and Clustering models, along with SHAP-based interpretability for all.
